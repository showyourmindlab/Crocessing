# Crocessing

Crocessing is a C Library for Processing Style Programming in C
Language. Processing provides an easy way to program for interactive
visual experience, but is slow in performance. C is fast in
performance, but difficult to program. 
"Crocessing" aims to fill the gap. It is a C library that allows
code written in Processing to run as fast as native C code with
minimal changes.

* Crocessing depends on a few other external libraries: 
Glut (for graphics)
FMOD (for audio)
SOIL (for image)
