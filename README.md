# Crocessing
Library for Processing Style Programming in C Language.  Processing provides an easy way to program for interactive visual experience, but is slow in performance. C is fast in performance, but difficult to program. "Crocessing" aims to fill the gap. It is a C library that allows code written in Processing to run as fast as native C code with minimal changes.
